Alright, hold on, let me start on with a different opening line:

# The Rules of What's in a Rose

I'm going to present with you a few lessons about finding the right handle. I've learned these mostly from the hellish circus of massively-scaled services over the past 11 years (so you know it's aged and true wisdom), like AIM screennames, deviantArt, blogs of all kinds, MMORPGs across servers, forums, communities, webrings, to personal domains, personal branding, Twitter professionalism to anonymous unprofessionalism:


## If you want to be remembered on the Internet:
1. Have something unique. If the handle you've chosen has an overabundance of interesting sounding results that come up on a search engine already, pick something else. If there's already an online store on Etsy with that name, tough luck. It's already game over.
2. Be as neutral and timeless as possible. Pick a handle that sounds like it could be inbetween time periods of Bands-That-Named-Themselves-Off-Trends. Go inbetween The "Insert Plural Nouns," the Noonerism Spames/Spoonerism Names, the bands that evoke Mountain Scenery, and so on and so forth.
3. Justify in your brain that there's some sort of design between the name and what you want to communicate. Hahaha, just kidding, this isn't really a rule, I just think it's fun as hell.


But really, what I mean about that last point is
> design your name with fun intentionality.
You get to choose it, so put all the attitude (or lack of attitude) you want in it.


Now, let me go through a couple of lessons I've learned about other kinds of names:

## Rules to Live By for Surviving Comfortably with a RL Name:
1. Have a name that's easy to say to someone when ordering coffee in your country of choice.
2. Have a name that's easy to spell for the barista when ordering coffee.
3. Have a name that's easy to recognize when being called for your coffee order at a cafe.
4. Have a name that can fit on an standardized test form.
5. You don't get to choose your name, so, if your given name violates any one of these, what can you do?


> My given name actually happens to violate all of these rules.

My given name actually happens to violate all of these rules.

To be honest, I've never been too bitter about my given name. That's mostly because the biggest inconveniences is just spelling, recognizability, awkwardness when meeting people, fitting my name onto government forms, having it mispronounced, and a lot of questioning and hesitance that seems to scream-- "You don't belong here. Kathy, why don't you come up to the stage and receive this award instead?"

## Rules to Live By for Being Successful with a RL Name:
1. Have a name that White America perceives is aligned with how successful you want to be
2. Have a name that White America perceives is aligned with what kind of successful you want to be


I recently found a visual artist on the Internet-- I found her through her pottery and ceramics, but to find her illustration! And her zine work! Incredible -- her body of work hit a kindness, attention to detail, and aura of comfort, all centered around fanart of Japanese RPGs. It was refreshing and extremely well done and--
and when I saw her personal page, I saw that her artist name, her fake name, was remarkably unmistakenably a Japanese surname, yet, on her biography, she listed her real name: absolutely not Japanese. It was extremely not-Eastern, it was, undoubtedly, a Hispanic last name.


But why? Why did she do that? Why did she change her name?

> I hypothesize that she might have had such a drastically different artist name in order to more easily be successful in the eyes of the public as an artist.


### Erasure + White-Washing in my own name.

I caught up with my mother the other day through a phone call. We talked about something that everyone in my family had dealt with for our whole lives in the States: my mom told me about how she filled out a government form recently, and they didn't quite like how she wanted to keep her maiden name within her "official name" (? still a little confused about that).

I told her about the time in 2014 when I had to give my full-name for a conference I was participating in and my co-presenter asked me if I spelled my last name with a lowercase, and how I told my co-presenter "no, but I get that a lot." And my mother told me, "Oh, yeah, it's supposed to be spelled with a lowercase letter."

> For all 22 years of my life I had mispelled my last name.

My last name is, now I know, an indicator of my family's birth place. It is proper for it to have a certain capitalization that does not conform to Western audiences outside of Leonardo da Vinci (still spelled Da Vinci if you're using this name to sell very authentic Italian pizza in the States).

My mother told me about how she's had to interchange between two different "middle names" because when she first immigrated to the United States she didn't understand what they meant. My mother has told me about how she wanted to name her first son, my older brother, a certain name, but chose instead to name him after my father to conform to Western culture. My mother has told me to discard our middle name tradition, saying, "Oh absolutely, when you have a child, your child's middle name Kate or something." My mom has made a lot of sacrifices with our family name for decades.



> I'm going to reject the first two sets of rules, and intentionally choose a name that is not for the comfort of others nor for the sake of success in the States.


Let me try to be responsible with my freedom for creating a fake name for the Internet.

But on a serious note, here is the list of rules I made for myself when deciding my pen name. My own pen name:

1. Must not imply that I come from a drastically different background than I truly do simply for the comfort of others.
2. Must not imply that I come from a drastically different background than I truly do simply to commodify my identity.
3. Must conform instead to the Rules of Names on the Internet.
4. Must not be more beautiful than my given name


The last rule is actually a given; I love my given name and I think it's the bees knees.

But here we go,
here we are,
an easily Internet-able:
Dee dirosa.
