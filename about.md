title: About Dee dirosa
---

I'm Dee dirosa: an Atlanta-based enthusiasm enthusiast, software developer, and hobbyist game developer.

My real name is Dannielle. Dee dirosa is just a pen name. It's fine.

I'm an optimistic nerd to a fault:

1. someone once described my point of view on life as "enchanted reality not augmented reality"
2. I learned a lot of hard life lessons about discrimination when I was 10 years old playing as a halfling in Neverwinter Nights
3. I believe that the power of friendship will always save the day.
