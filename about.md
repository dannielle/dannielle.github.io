title: About dee dannielle
---

I'm dee: an Atlanta-based enthusiasm enthusiast, software developer, and hobbyist game developer.

I'm an optimistic nerd to a fault:

1. Someone once described my point of view on life as "enchanted reality not augmented reality"
2. I learned a lot of hard life lessons about discrimination when I was 10 years old playing as a halfling in Neverwinter Nights
3. I believe that the power of friendship will always save the day.
